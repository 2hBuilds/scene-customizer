 * in the same breath lands on the old tab, and RuneLite then falls back to another plugin's tab when the old one goes.
 * The open is therefore handed to {@code later}, after the add, and it opens the new button only if that button is
 * still the plugin's current one. The button type is generic so the order can be checked without a client.
